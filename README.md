# Tech-Moda
Tech Moda Repository.
In this app we develop a mobile app store for clothing called TechModa. This app was made by Fabio Sanchez (Scrum Master) and all the collaborators on this repository
for MisionTIC 2022 in Universidad Nacional de Colombia

This app was made fully with Kotlin in Android Studio and implementing Firebase and it's tools making a CRUD for this app. 
This app was made also to implement Google's Map API so we can show up a location and all the tools google give us.
This app was made for Learning purposes and it's not manetizable by any way.
